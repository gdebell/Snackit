## What is Snackit?

### Snackit is a website designed to bring produce in grocery stores that might otherwise be thrown out, to students in schools to improve nutrition.  Snackit does this with the help of a volunteers.  The volunteer can enter two locations and Snackit will calculate the most efficient route to a grocery store and a school that is partnered with Snackit.  (The stores have donations, and the schools are accepting donations.)

## Technologies Used:

### JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, NodeJS, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Knex, Express.js, Google Maps API, and the Twilio API.
